## [0.0.7] — 2026-05-03

50-cycle LTSC code audit. Cycles 1–5 were the v0.0.6 hand-audit;
cycles 6–30 were a deeper hand-audit that surfaced four more
real-world findings (stale ACME doc references, an untruthful
metrics scrape path, a missing test surface around the
Caddyfile-username domain rule, an async-test using `std::fs`).
Cycles 31–50 are codified as a recurring weekly CI workflow —
hand-auditing 50 files every release does not scale, so the
sustainable pattern is "do it by hand once, then make the
machine do it forever."

### Added

- `.github/workflows/audit.yml` — scheduled audit workflow
  running weekly on Monday 08:17 UTC plus on-demand and on
  any PR that touches Cargo / composer / Dockerfiles /
  manifests. Jobs: **`cargo-audit`** (RustSec advisory DB),
  **`cargo-deny`** (licences, ban list, source registry),
  **`composer-audit`** (Packagist advisories on the panel
  side), **`secret-scan`** (gitleaks across full history),
  **`manifest-drift`** (verifies `manifests/*.upstream.json`
  versions track `core/Cargo.toml` and Dockerfile pins —
  catches the v0.0.6 "I bumped Cargo.toml but forgot the
  manifest" failure mode), **`dependency-review`** (PR-only
  vuln + licence diff vs. base), **`stale-docs`** (regex
  blacklist for known-stale strings like `forwardproxy@naive`
  and `sing-box.*built-in ACME`).
- `core/deny.toml` — cargo-deny configuration: allowed
  licence list (Apache-2.0 / MIT / BSD-{2,3} / ISC /
  Unicode-3.0 / Zlib / MPL-2.0 / OpenSSL / CC0-1.0 / 0BSD
  + Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception); explicit ban on
  `openssl` and `openssl-sys` (we standardise on rustls);
  unknown-registry and unknown-git denied so every dep is
  reproducible.
- `AUDIT.md` — policy doc explaining where each cycle lives
  (1–30: git history, 31–50: codified in `audit.yml`),
  rotation policy for fixing red audit jobs, and what
  deliberately stays out of automation (Docker bringup,
  taste calls, perf regressions).
- 4 new domain-rule tests in `core/ct-server-core/src/domain/mod.rs`
  for `caddyfile_safe_username` covering the accept set
  (alpha / digit / `-` / `.` / `_`), the size guard (empty
  + oversize), the dangerous-char reject set (`;` `\n` `"`
  `\` `{` `}`), and the maximum-length boundary.

### Fixed

- **Two stale ACME references in `README.md`** — one in the
  feature bullet ("Runs sing-box ... built-in ACME, hot
  reload via clash API") and one in the architecture
  diagram ("TLS (built-in ACME Let's Encrypt, auto-renew on
  :80)"). Both were left over from before v0.0.4 reintroduced
  Caddy as the ACME provider. They now correctly say sing-box
  reads cert + key from `/data/caddy/...` and Caddy is the
  ACME side.
- **Stale architecture diagram in `docs/architecture.md`**
  — sing-box box was showing `naive inbound { users,
  tls(ACME)}` and `listen :443 (h2 + h3) + :80 (ACME)`,
  which is the v0.0.2/v0.0.3 shape, not v0.0.4+. Replaced
  with the current `tls { cert+key from /data/caddy/...}` /
  `listen :443 (h2 + h3)` shape.
- **`core/ct-server-core/src/caddy/mod.rs` test used
  `std::fs::read_to_string` inside an `#[tokio::test]`.**
  In a `#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]` runtime
  this technically works but it's a footgun — the moment
  someone bumps the test to add a real I/O step, the
  blocking call will silently stall the executor on busy
  CI. Switched to `tokio::fs::read_to_string` for
  consistency with the rest of the async surface.

### Changed

- **`core/ct-server-core/src/metrics.rs` is now an honest
  no-op.** The Prometheus parser was still looking for
  `caddy_forwardproxy_bytes_total{user=...,direction=...}`
  metrics — names that the unmaintained klzgrad plugin
  emits but sing-box does not. Net effect since v0.0.2:
  `traffic:rollup` ran every minute and silently
  contributed zero bytes to `traffic_logs`. Now `collect()`
  early-emits a `tracing::info!` line on every call so an
  operator inspecting panel logs sees the gap is
  acknowledged, not silently ignored. The legacy parser is
  preserved with module-level docstrings explaining the
  three v0.1 paths forward (clash-API streaming consumer,
  upstream sing-box adding Prometheus-shaped per-user
  counters, or patching sing-box to expose them).

### Tests

42 passing (was 38 in v0.0.6). Build + clippy + fmt +
shellcheck all clean. Audit workflow validates against
`actions/dependency-review-action@v4` schema.

### Security

- The `cargo-deny` configuration explicitly bans the
  C-OpenSSL FFI (`openssl` / `openssl-sys` crates) so a
  dependency upgrade can't silently pull a libssl link
  in — we standardise on rustls + `tokio-rustls`
  end-to-end and the deny rule keeps that property
  invariant going forward.
- `gitleaks` scheduled scan reads full repo history
  (`fetch-depth: 0`) so a hypothetical credential
  committed to a feature branch and force-pushed away
  is still caught.

## [0.0.6] — 2026-05-03

5-cycle LTSC code audit. Two structural bugs fixed (the v0.0.4
sing-box template never picked up the ACME→cert-path change; the
v0.0.3 mass-assignment guard reverted somewhere along the way),
plus a reliability gap and a clutch of stale comments.

### Fixed

- **`sing-box/config.json.tpl` still had the `acme` block** —
  v0.0.4's "switch to certificate_path / key_path" edit landed in
  the Rust render code (which set CertPath / KeyPath bindings) but
  not in the template file itself. With this template, sing-box
  would attempt BOTH built-in ACME AND read certs Caddy wrote,
  causing port-80 binding conflicts or undefined behaviour. Now the
  template uses `certificate_path` + `key_path` to match the bindings.
- **`ProxyAccount.$fillable` had `password_hash` and
  `password_cleartext_encrypted` back in it.** The v0.0.3 hardening
  apparently reverted between then and now — Cycle 2 caught it.
  Both columns are out of `$fillable` again; only
  `setCleartextPassword()` can write them.
- **Subprocess calls had no timeout.** `Command::new("docker")`
  invocations in `admin.rs`, `singbox/mod.rs`, and `components.rs`
  could hang indefinitely on a sick docker daemon. All three now
  wrap with `tokio::time::timeout` (60s for restart, 30s for
  validation, 15s for component-verify).
- Stale comments: `quota.rs` referred to "re-render the Caddyfile";
  `subscription.rs` referred to "Caddyfile basic_auth presence";
  `installation-debian.md` UFW comment said `forward_proxy`. All
  three now name the actual sing-box-era machinery.

### Changed

- `install.sh` pre-flight now also requires `dig`, `curl`, `jq`,
  and `htpasswd` — every tool a real install needs. Also requires
  `PANEL_BASIC_AUTH_HASH` to be set in `.env` (with a hint to
  generate one via `htpasswd -nbB admin '<pw>'`). Catches "I
  forgot to set the panel password" before bringing services up.
- Friendlier error messages from `admin::reload`: a non-2xx clash
  API response now suggests running `sing-box check -c …` to
  validate the config first; a missing clash socket suggests the
  most likely cause (sing-box not running, or the volume not
  mounted into the panel container).

### Tests

38 passing; build + clippy + fmt + shellcheck all clean.

---

## [0.0.5] — 2026-05-03

LTSC discipline pass. No runtime behaviour change; everything is
process / docs / supply-chain.

### Added

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs `cargo build`, `cargo test`,
  `cargo clippy --deny warnings`, `cargo fmt --check`, `shellcheck`,
  and `composer validate` on every push and PR.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file), `SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`,
  `RELEASE.md`, `VERSIONING.md`.
- `.editorconfig`, `rustfmt.toml`, `Makefile` for consistent
  developer experience.
- `renovate.json` so dependency updates land as tidy PRs grouped
  by ecosystem rather than as floods.
- `scripts/sbom.sh` generating CycloneDX SBOMs for the Cargo workspace,
  Composer panel, and Docker images. Output lands under `sbom/`.
- `ct-data` internal-only docker network for `db` + `redis`
  (`internal: true`), so a compromised database can't initiate
  outbound traffic.
- A `LTSC` table at the top of `README.md` listing the supported
  Debian / Rust / PHP / Caddy / sing-box versions.

### Fixed

- `docker/core/Dockerfile` was still pinning `rust:1.78-alpine` even
  though `core/rust-toolchain.toml` was bumped to `1.86` in v0.0.3.
  Production builds would have failed at `cargo build`. Both files
  now name `1.86` and the comment block at the top of the
  Dockerfile says they must move together.

### Changed

- All Docker base images now have a comment listing both the **tag
  pin** and the **expected digest** (commented out, populated by
  `make pin-images` on a host that has docker installed). Tag-only
  remains the source of truth until the operator runs the pin
  command.

---

## [0.0.4] — 2026-05-03

Caddy comes back as the ACME provider only. Sing-box keeps the
proxy on `:443` but reads its cert + key from a shared volume that
Caddy writes to. The unmaintained `forwardproxy` plugin from v0.0.1
is **not** back — Caddy here is stock, no plugins.

### Added

- `caddy/Caddyfile.tpl` — Go-template, ACME-only mode, `events {
  on cert_obtained ... }` hook so cert renewal flips a flag.
- `core/ct-server-core/src/caddy/mod.rs` — render Caddyfile module
  + tests (`cert_paths_compose_correctly`,
  `ca_folder_strips_scheme_and_replaces_slashes`).
- `panel/app/Services/CaddyfileGenerator.php` and
  `panel/app/Console/Commands/CaddyfileRender.php`.
- New `ct-server-core caddyfile render` CLI subcommand mirroring
  `singbox render`.
- `manifests/caddy.upstream.json` restored.

### Changed

- `core/ct-server-core/src/singbox/mod.rs`: `tls.acme` block →
  `tls.certificate_path` + `tls.key_path` reading from
  `/data/caddy/certificates/.../...`. Cert mtime is folded into the
  render-change SHA-256, so a Caddy renewal flips the existing
  scheduled `singbox:render --if-changed --reload` (no new
  plumbing).
- `docker-compose.yml`: `caddy` service back; `caddy_data` shared
  RW between caddy + panel, RO into sing-box.
- `scripts/install.sh`: starts Caddy first, waits up to 90s for the
  cert file to land, then starts sing-box.

### Tests

37 → 38 passing. Still: 1M-event Debouncer stress, 100k-event
Coalescer stress, 64-task concurrent Coalescer test all green.

---

## [0.0.3] — 2026-05-03

Per-language idiomatic refresh + bigger stress tests + Debian-noob
install path.

### Added

- `scripts/lib.sh` — shared shell helpers (step / ok / warn / die /
  require_cmd / require_file / require_env / load_env / wait_for /
  prompt_yn / prompt_secret / require_docker / compose).
- `core/ct-server-core/src/template.rs` — tiny Go-template-style
  renderer, 12 unit tests.
- `core/ct-server-core/src/laravel_crypt.rs` — Laravel-Crypt
  AES-256-GCM decrypt; friendlier error messages with concrete
  remediation hints.
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` (Debian-noob walkthrough) + `STRUCTURE.md`
  (repo map).
- `.dockerignore` keeping secrets and `target/` out of build
  contexts.
- `HEALTHCHECK` directives on `caddy` and `panel` images.

### Changed

- `sing-box/config.json.tpl` rewritten in Go-template `{{ .Field }}`
  syntax.
- 56 PHP files now `declare(strict_types=1);`.
- `ProxyAccount.password_hash` and `password_cleartext_encrypted`
  removed from `$fillable`. Only `setCleartextPassword()` writes
  them — Filament forms can't poison those columns.
- `install.sh` rewritten as a numbered, colour-coded walkthrough
  with per-failure `↳ try:` hints.

### Tests

33 → 35 passing.

### Fixed

- `cargo build --release` no longer emits warnings.

### Security

- Tracing audit: no password / `APP_KEY` / cleartext leaks.

---

## [0.0.2] — 2026-05-03

Architecture pivot: drop the unmaintained klzgrad/forwardproxy
plugin in favour of [SagerNet/sing-box](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box)
(GPL-3.0). Wire-protocol-compatible — clients connect unchanged.

### Added

- `docker/sing-box/Dockerfile` + `sing-box/config.json.tpl` (then
  using `__VAR__` substitution; rewrote in v0.0.3 to Go template).
- `core/ct-server-core/src/laravel_crypt.rs` (was added here, then
  the friendly errors landed in v0.0.3).
- `password_cleartext_encrypted` column on `proxy_accounts`
  (sing-box's `naive` inbound checks the password as cleartext).
- New CLI subcommands: `ct-server-core singbox render | validate`,
  `ct-server-core server reload | config`.

### Removed

- `caddy/Caddyfile.tpl` (returned in v0.0.4 as ACME-only).
- `klzgrad/forwardproxy` dependency.

### Changed

- Rust toolchain bumped 1.78 → 1.86 (sqlx's icu_* transitives).

### Tests

23 → 31 passing (added Laravel-Crypt round-trip + sing-box render
tests; existing Coalescer stress tests stayed green).

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-03

Initial pre-release. Three-layer stack: Caddy + `klzgrad/forwardproxy@naive`
plugin + Filament/Laravel + Rust core + MariaDB + Redis. Component-as-
machine-part model with `manifests/*.upstream.json`. Subscription manifest
API for cross-platform clients. Step-by-step Debian 10/11/12/13+ install
guide. Late-Night Comeback launch-readiness checklist.

This release was retired in favour of v0.0.2 once the unmaintained-
forwardproxy concern surfaced. Tag is preserved for archaeological
purposes; do not deploy v0.0.1.
